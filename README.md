# keeb-x3
a 1800-type ortholinear keyboard with 105 keys

![Render](pics/layout.png)

- this is my attempt as a contenporain keyboard, ditching the legacy staggered layout for ortho, which to me makes way more sense since we don't have to deal with typewriter hammers anymore.
- it is also made to be easily swapped between QWERTY, Dvorak and Colemak, to accentuate the need to detach ourselves from the 1873 typewriters.


### Currently using a RP pico but a v2:tm: could use a rp2040 and SMD components directly

The Pico's USB B have to be wired to the "keeb-x3"'s USB C port by using the "TP1, TP2, TP3" pads availlable on the bottom of the Pico
