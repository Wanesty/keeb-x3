# The RP2040 chip-powered V2 of this project has been relocated to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Wanesty/keeb-x3)
it's developement will remain there for present and future iterations if I ultimately favor it over GitHub.

# keeb-x3
a 1800-style ortholinear keyboard with 105 keys

![Render](pics/layout.png)

- this is my attempt as a contenporain keyboard, ditching the legacy staggered layout for ortho, which to me makes way more sense since we don't have to deal with typewriter hammers anymore.
- it is also made to be easily swapped between QWERTY, Dvorak and Colemak, to accentuate the need to detach ourselves from the 1873 typewriters.



#### The Pico's USB B have to be wired to the "keeb-x3"'s USB C port by using the "TP1, TP2, TP3" pads availlable on the bottom of the Pico
